# Definitions used to identify known bugs.
#
# Supported fields (for full details see common.checks.BugChecksBase):
#
# * expr: regex pattern used to match a log entry that identifies the bug.
#
# * hint: optional short pattern used as a pre-filter before trying expr.
#
# * reason: info to display along with the bug.
#
# * reason-format-result-groups: optional list of python.re match group ids
#   that are available when expr is matched and that we want to use as format
#   input to reason.
#
# * path: relative path to file/directory we want to search.
#
# * allow-all-logs: whether to allow path to be wildcarded. The default
#                   is True and should be set to False if searching full
#                   history will result in excessive load or execution time.
#
# TIP: to use a single quote ' inside a yaml string you need to replace it with
#      two single quotes.
