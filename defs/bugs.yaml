# Definitions used to identify known bugs.
#
# Structure of definition is:
#
#   PLUGIN_NAME:
#     GROUP_NAME:
#       BUG_ID:
#         FIELDS
#
# GROUP_NAME - this is required but has no actual meaning and is just way to
#              organise definitions.
#
# FIELDS (for full details see common.checks.BugChecksBase):
#
# Mandatory:
#
#   * expr: python.re regex pattern used to match line(s).
#
#     TIP: to use a single quote ' inside a yaml string you need to replace it
#          with two single quotes.
#
#   * reason: info displayed in output describing the bug/issue.
#
#   * path: relative path to file/directory we want to search.
#
# Optional:
#
#   * allow-all-logs: whether to allow path to be wildcarded. The default
#                     is True and should be set to False if searching full
#                     history will result in excessive load or execution time.
#
#   * reason-format-result-groups: optional list of python.re match group ids
#     that are available when expr is matched and that we want to use as input
#     reason when it is a formatted string.
#
#   * hint: optional short pattern used as a pre-filter before trying expr.
