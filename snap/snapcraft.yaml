summary: Tool create a summary of a sosreport.
description:
  Sosreports contain a very large amount of information and we
  sometimes find ourselves repeatedly searching for the same
  information and sometimes that information requires extra logic
  to obtain which is time consuming. This tool aims save time by
  providing an instant summary of information with optional
  levels of extra verbosity. The areas reported on are mostly
  application-specific so as to set it apart from more
  system-oriented summary tools.
