    SystemWarnings:
      - Unattended upgrades are enabled which can lead to uncontrolled changes to
        this environment. If maintenance windows are required please consider disabling
        unattended upgrades. (origin=system.auto_scenario_check)
  storage:
    BcacheWarnings:
      - bcache config sequential_cutoff expected to be eq 0.0k but actual=None (origin=storage.auto_config_check)
      - Detected bcache devices but found no bcache-tuning unit. It's recommended
        that bcache-tuning charm is deployed to configure params for optimal performance.
        (origin=storage.bcache)
    CephWarnings:
      - 'The status of this Ceph cluster is HEALTH_WARN and the mon is configured
        to allow insecure global_id reclaim which means the status will never go to
        HEALTH_OK. Action should be taken to review the options discussed in the following:

        https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/security/CVE-2021-20288/#fix-details. (origin=storage.auto_scenario_check)'
    CephMapsWarnings:
      - Found 5496 pinned osdmaps. This can affect mon's performance and also indicate
        bugs such as https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/44184 and https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/47290.
        (origin=storage.auto_scenario_check)
    CephHealthWarnings:
      - Ceph cluster is in 'HEALTH_WARN' state. Please check 'ceph status' for details
        (origin=storage.ceph_cluster_checks)
    CephOSDWarnings:
      - Found 1 osd(s) with metadata size larger than 10G. This could be the result
        of a compaction failure/bug and this host may be affected by https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/45903.
        A workaround (>= Nautilus) is to manually compact using 'ceph-bluestore-tool'
        (origin=storage.ceph_cluster_checks)
    CephCrushErrors:
      - Found 1 osd(s) with > 500 pgs - this is close to the hard limit at which point
        they will stop creating pgs and fail - please investigate (origin=storage.ceph_cluster_checks)
    CephCrushWarnings:
      - Found 2 osd(s) with > 30% margin from optimal 50-200 pgs. (origin=storage.ceph_cluster_checks)
    CephOSDErrors:
      - Detected superblock read errors which indicates an OSD disk failure or its
        likely failure in the near future. This drive needs to be inspected further
        using sar/smartctl. (origin=storage.ceph_event_checks)
  kernel:
    MemoryWarnings:
      - compaction failures are at 29% of successes (see ./tests/unit/fake_data_root/proc/vmstat).

      - oom-killer invoked for process 'nice' at Aug  3 08:32:23. (origin=kernel.log_event_checks)
    KernelErrors:
      - kern.log contains 1 stacktraces. (origin=kernel.log_event_checks)
    NetworkWarnings:
      - kernel has reported over-mtu dropped packets for (1) interfaces. (origin=kernel.log_event_checks)
      - kernel has reported nf_conntrack_full - please check. (origin=kernel.log_event_checks)
