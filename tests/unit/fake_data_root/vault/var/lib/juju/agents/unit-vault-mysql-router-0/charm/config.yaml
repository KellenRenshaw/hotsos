  "base-port":
    "type": "int"
    "default": !!int "3306"
    "description": |
      Base port number for RW interface. RO, xRW and xRO will

    "default": !!float ".5"
    "description": |
      Time to live (in seconds) of information in the metadata cache.
      Accepts either an integer or a floating point value. The granularity is
      limited to milliseconds, where 0.001 equates to one millisecond.
      Precision is truncated to the supported range; for example ttl=0.0119
      is treated as 11 milliseconds. The value 0 means that the metadata
      cache module queries the metadata continuously in a tight loop.
  "auth_cache_refresh_interval":
    "type": "int"
    "default": !!int "2"
    "description": |

  "auth_cache_ttl":
    "type": "int"
    "default": !!int "-1"
    "description": |
      Time (in seconds) until the cache becomes invalid if not refreshed.
      Defaults to -1 (infinite). The value must be larger than
